Early prototype stage. If it sounds interesting to you -
Input and ideas are very welcome :)

# Possible visions

* Type-a-book. Read a book by typing it out. This tool will keep track of spent time and typed progress.
* Typing training with harsh cutoff limit. So many typing trainers are nice and cuddly and sometimes doesn't even punish you when doing typing errors, resulting in sloppy writing, and a feeling of 'I can type so fast', when you actually are unable to type accurately.
* System for daily challenges, and tracking over time. Visualizing progress, and syncing through Dropbox.
